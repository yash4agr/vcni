        "designSummary": "**The Dynamic Interface: A Sci-Fi Dashboard Synthesis**\n\nThe vision is to create a user interface that feels like a direct portal into a futuristic, high-performance command center. We are synthesizing the precision of a calculated split-screen layout with the dynamic, layered aesthetics of sci-fi dashboards. The goal is to convey cutting-edge technology, instantaneous response, and intelligent interaction, making the user feel empowered and in control of a sophisticated system.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. **Split-Screen Architecture:** A fundamental 35/65 split defines the primary layout, creating distinct zones for input and action. This division is not static; it's the canvas for dynamic content.\n2. **Layered Depth & Asymmetry:** Elements will be layered using subtle transparency, glowing effects, and strategic overlaps to create a sense of technological depth. Calculated asymmetry will be employed within each panel to avoid rigid uniformity and enhance visual interest.\n3. **The 8-Pixel Rhythm:** All spacing, padding, and margins will adhere to a strict 8px base unit, ensuring visual harmony and a precise, engineered feel across all elements.\n4. **Interactive Visualizations:** Animations will be smooth, precise, and functional, serving to visualize data, indicate system status, or highlight interactive elements, reinforcing the high-tech, responsive nature of the interface.",

    "designSummary": "**The Dynamic Interface: A Sci-Fi Dashboard Synthesis**\n\nThe vision is to create a user interface that feels like a direct portal into a futuristic, high-performance command center. We are synthesizing the precision of a calculated split-screen layout with the dynamic, layered aesthetics of sci-fi dashboards. The goal is to convey cutting-edge technology, instantaneous response, and intelligent interaction, making the user feel empowered and in control of a sophisticated system.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. **Split-Screen Architecture:** A fundamental 35/65 split defines the primary layout, creating distinct zones for input and action. This division is not static; it's the canvas for dynamic content.\n2. **Layered Depth & Asymmetry:** Elements will be layered using subtle transparency, glowing effects, and strategic overlaps to create a sense of technological depth. Calculated asymmetry will be employed within each panel to avoid rigid uniformity and enhance visual interest.\n3. **The 8-Pixel Rhythm:** All spacing, padding, and margins will adhere to a strict 8px base unit, ensuring visual harmony and a precise, engineered feel across all elements.\n4. **Interactive Visualizations:** Animations will be smooth, precise, and functional, serving to visualize data, indicate system status, or highlight interactive elements, reinforcing the high-tech, responsive nature of the interface.",
